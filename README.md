# Automatic Model Generation through State Reconstruction

This repository is created to share Python scripts, Arena instances and event logs for reproducing experiment results reported in our paper:

* L. Zhu, G. Lugaresi and A. Matta. **Automatic Generation of Digital Twins for Manufacturing Systems through State Reconstruction**. Submitted to *the 19th IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering*.

## Guide

The scripts have been tested with Python 3.9 and require the availability of `pandas`, `networkx`, `pygraphviz`, `numpy` and `matplotlib`. Apart from these Python libraries, you also need to install the latest version of [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download) (make sure that *Add Graphviz to the system PATH* is selected in the case of Windows).

Once the runtime environment has been set up, you can try the examples by executing

    python run_examples.py
The following command allows you to draw the results based on models that we generated:

    python run_experiments.py
If you want to redo the experiments, uncomment from line 18 to 28 and then execute this command, which may take up to a few hours depending on the performance of the host.
